#### 🚀 I’ve developed Hashchat app! 🔐💬
##### -> Hashchat is a Swift/SwiftUI-powered real-time encrypted chat application featuring classical ciphers implemented manually and modern cryptography using industry-standard frameworks.

#### 🔍 Key Features:
##### -> 🔐 Multiple encryption algorithms (Caesar, Vigenère, Hill, Columnar, Rail Fence, Euclid)
##### -> 🔒 Advanced cryptography support:
##### • AES-128 (CTR Mode) — pure Swift implementation
##### • DES (CBC Mode) — full manual implementation
##### • RSA-2048 (E2EE) — production-ready end-to-end encryption

##### -> 🔄 Real-time encrypted messaging using WebSockets
##### -> 🧊 Clean and modern SwiftUI interface with smooth transitions
##### -> ⚙️ Modular architecture (MVVM + Clean Architecture)
##### -> 🧠 Educational design: perfect for learning how encryption works by actually sending encrypted messages
##### -> 📡 Automatic local encryption/decryption pipeline before and after message transfer

##### -> Hashchat includes both manual and library-based cryptographic systems for comparison and educational purposes.
##### Manual Implementations:
##### -> AES-128 CTR and DES CBC fully written in Swift, including round functions, S-boxes, permutations, and key scheduling.
##### CommonCrypto Implementations:
##### -> High-performance AES-128 CTR and DES CBC using Apple’s optimized cryptographic engine.
##### Built-in Benchmark System:
##### -> Measures and compares execution times of manual vs CommonCrypto implementations directly inside the app.

##### Example output:

#### 🔑 RSA End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
##### -> Hashchat features production-grade End-to-End Encryption using RSA — mirroring security standards of apps like WhatsApp and Signal.

##### How it works:
##### -> Dynamic Key Generation:
- Each user gets a unique 2048-bit RSA keypair generated on first use
- Generated using Apple's `SecKeyCreateRandomKey()` with RSA-OAEP-SHA256
- No manual key generation or external tools required

##### -> Secure Storage:
- Private Key: Stored in iOS Keychain with hardware encryption (`kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`)
- Public Key: Distributed via backend REST API for secure message exchange
- Keys persist across app restarts and device reboots

##### -> Automatic Registration:
- On first RSA use, user is auto-registered with backend
- Public key is uploaded to server for other users to fetch
- Backend provides key distribution via REST endpoints:
  - `POST /register` — Register user with public key
  - `GET /users/{username}/public-key` — Fetch recipient's public key

##### -> Message Flow:
1. Alice types "Hello Alex"
2. App fetches Alex's public key from backend
3. Message encrypted client-side with Alex's public key (RSA-OAEP-SHA256)
4. Encrypted ciphertext sent via WebSocket
5. Alex receives encrypted message
6. Alex's app decrypts using his private key (stored in Keychain)
7. Alex sees "Hello Alex"

##### -> Security Features:
- Zero-knowledge server (backend cannot decrypt messages)
- Private keys never leave the device
- Hardware-backed Keychain storage
- 2048-bit RSA with modern OAEP padding
- Unique keypair per user (no shared keys)

##### -> Educational Purpose:
- Demonstrates real-world public-key cryptography
- Shows difference between symmetric (AES/DES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption
- Teaches key management, DER formats, and E2EE pipelines
- Illustrates how modern messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal) implement E2EE

#### 🛡️ Security Validation with Wireshark
##### -> To verify that messages are truly encrypted end-to-end, I used Wireshark to inspect live WebSocket packets.
- All transmitted messages appear as encrypted byte streams
- No plain-text data ever leaves the device
- Validates the integrity of AES, DES, and RSA implementations
